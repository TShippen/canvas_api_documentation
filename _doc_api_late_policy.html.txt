  "course_id": 123,
  // whether to enable missing submission deductions
  "missing_submission_deduction_enabled": true,
  // amount of percentage points to deduct
  "missing_submission_deduction": 12.34,
  // whether to enable late submission deductions
  "late_submission_deduction_enabled": true,
  // amount of percentage points to deduct per late_submission_interval
  "late_submission_deduction": 12.34,
  // time interval for late submission deduction
  "late_submission_interval": "hour",
  // whether to enable late submission minimum percent
  "late_submission_minimum_percent_enabled": true,
  // the minimum score a submission can receive in percentage points
  "late_submission_minimum_percent": 12.34,
  // the time at which this late policy was originally created
  "created_at": "2012-07-01T23:59:00-06:00",
