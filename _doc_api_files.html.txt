Files API


An API for managing files and folders
See the File Upload Documentation for details on the file upload workflow.


A File object looks like:

Parameter |  | Type | Description
replace |  | boolean | This action is irreversible. If replace is set to true the file contents will be replaced with a generic âfile has been removedâ file. This also destroys any previews that have been generated for the file. Must have manage files and become other users permissions
