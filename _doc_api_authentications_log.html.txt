Authentications Log API


Query audit log of authentication events (logins and logouts).
For each endpoint, a compound document is returned. The primary collection of
event objects is paginated, ordered by date descending. Secondary collections
of logins, accounts, page views, and users related to the returned events
are also included. Refer to the Logins, Accounts, Page Views, and Users APIs
for descriptions of the objects in those collections.
Authentication logs are stored for one year.


An AuthenticationEvent object looks like:

{
  // timestamp of the event
  "created_at": "2012-07-19T15:00:00-06:00",
  // authentication event type ('login' or 'logout')
  "event_type": "login",
  // ID of the pseudonym (login) associated with the event
  "pseudonym_id": 9478,
  // ID of the account associated with the event. will match the account_id in the
  // associated pseudonym.
  "account_id": 2319,
  // ID of the user associated with the event will match the user_id in the
  // associated pseudonym.
  "user_id": 362
}
