Appointment Groups API


API for creating, accessing and updating appointment groups. Appointment groups
provide a way of creating a bundle of time slots that users can sign up for
(e.g. "Office Hours" or "Meet with professor about Final Project"). Both time
slots and reservations of time slots are stored as Calendar Events.


An Appointment object looks like:

// Date and time for an appointment
{
  // The appointment identifier.
  "id": 987,
  // Start time for the appointment
  "start_at": "2012-07-20T15:00:00-06:00",
  // End time for the appointment
  "end_at": "2012-07-20T15:00:00-06:00"
}


An AppointmentGroup object looks like:

{
  // The ID of the appointment group
  "id": 543,
  // The title of the appointment group
  "title": "Final Presentation",
  // The start of the first time slot in the appointment group
