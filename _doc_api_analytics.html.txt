Analytics API


API for retrieving the data exposed in Canvas Analytics


Get department-level participation data



GET /api/v1/accounts/:account_id/analytics/terms/:term_id/activity



GET /api/v1/accounts/:account_id/analytics/current/activity



GET /api/v1/accounts/:account_id/analytics/completed/activity

Returns page view hits summed across all courses in the department. Two groupings of these counts are returned; one by day (by_date), the other by category (by_category). The possible categories are announcements, assignments, collaborations, conferences, discussions, files, general, grades, groups, modules, other, pages, and quizzes.
This and the other department-level endpoints have three variations which all return the same style of data but for different subsets of courses. All share the prefix /api/v1/accounts/<account_id>/analytics. The possible suffixes are:
* /current: includes all available courses in the default term
* /completed: includes all concluded courses in the default term
* /terms/<term_id>: includes all available or concluded courses in the
  given term.
Courses not yet offered or which have been deleted are never included.
/current and /completed are intended for use when the account has only one term. /terms/<term_id> is intended for use when the account has multiple terms.
The action follows the suffix.

Get department-level grade data



GET /api/v1/accounts/:account_id/analytics/terms/:term_id/grades



GET /api/v1/accounts/:account_id/analytics/current/grades



GET /api/v1/accounts/:account_id/analytics/completed/grades

Returns the distribution of grades for students in courses in the department.  Each data point is one studentâs current grade in one course; if a student is in multiple courses, he contributes one value per course, but if heâs enrolled multiple times in the same course (e.g. a lecture section and a lab section), he only constributes on value for that course.
Grades are binned to the nearest integer score; anomalous grades outside the 0 to 100 range are ignored. The raw counts are returned, not yet normalized by the total count.

Get course-level participation data



GET /api/v1/courses/:course_id/analytics/activity

Returns page view hits and participation numbers grouped by day through the entire history of the course. Page views is returned as a hash, where the hash keys are dates in the format âYYYY-MM-DDâ. The page_views result set includes page views broken out by access category. Participations is returned as an array of dates in the format âYYYY-MM-DDâ.

Get course-level assignment data



GET /api/v1/courses/:course_id/analytics/assignments

Returns a list of assignments for the course sorted by due date. For each assignment returns basic assignment information, the grade breakdown, and a breakdown of on-time/late status of homework submissions.
Parameter |  | Type | Description
async |  | boolean | If async is true, then the course_assignments call can happen asynch- ronously and MAY return a response containing a progress_url key instead of an assignments array. If it does, then it is the callerâs responsibility to poll the API again to see if the progress is complete. If the data is ready (possibly even on the first async call) then it will be passed back normally, as documented in the example response.

Get course-level student summary data



GET /api/v1/courses/:course_id/analytics/student_summaries

Returns a summary of per-user access information for all students in a course. This includes total page views, total participations, and a breakdown of on-time/late status for all homework submissions in the course.
Each studentâs summary also includes the maximum number of page views and participations by any student in the course, which may be useful for some visualizations (since determining maximums client side can be tricky with pagination).
Parameter |  | Type | Description
sort_column |  | string | The order results in which results are returned.  Defaults to ânameâ.Allowed values:name,name_descending,score,score_descending,participations,participations_descending,page_views,page_views_descending
