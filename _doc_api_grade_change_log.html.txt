Grade Change Log API


Query audit log of grade change events.
For each endpoint, a compound document is returned. The primary collection of
event objects is paginated, ordered by date descending. Secondary collections
of assignments, courses, students and graders related to the returned events
are also included. Refer to the Assignment, Courses, and Users APIs for
descriptions of the objects in those collections.

  // associated assignment if the context type for the assignment is a course
  "course": 2319,
