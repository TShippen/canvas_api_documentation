Account Calendars API


API for viewing and toggling settings of account calendars.
An account calendar is available for each account in Canvas. All account calendars
are hidden by default, but administrators with themanage_account_calendar_visibilitypermission may set calendars as visible. Administrators with themanage_account_calendar_eventspermission can create events in visible account
calendars, and users associated with an account can add the calendar and see its
events (if the calendar is visible). Events on calendars set asauto_subscribecalendars will appear on users' calendars even if they do not manually add it.


An AccountCalendar object looks like:

{
  // the ID of the account associated with this calendar
  "id": 204,
  // the name of the account associated with this calendar
  "name": "Department of Chemistry",
  // the account's parent ID, or null if this is the root account
  "parent_account_id": 1,
  // the ID of the root account, or null if this is the root account
  "root_account_id": 1,
  // whether this calendar is visible to users
  "visible": true,
  // whether users see this calendar's events without needing to manually add it
  "auto_subscribe": false,
  // number of this account's direct sub-accounts
  "sub_account_count": 0,
  // Asset string of the account
  "asset_string": "account_4",
  // Object type
  "type": "account",
  // url to get full detailed events
  "calendar_event_url": "/accounts/2/calendar_events/%7B%7B%20id%20%7D%7D",
  // whether the user can create calendar events
  "can_create_calendar_events": true,
  // API path to create events for the account
  "create_calendar_event_url": "/accounts/2/calendar_events",
  // url to open the more options event editor
  "new_calendar_event_url": "/accounts/6/calendar_events/new"
}
