GET /api/v1/search/recipients

Pagination is supported.
Parameter |  | Type | Description
search |  | string | Search terms used for matching users/courses/groups (e.g. âbob smithâ). If multiple terms are given (separated via whitespace), only results matching all terms will be returned.
context |  | string | Limit the search to a particular course/group (e.g. âcourse_3â or âgroup_4â).
exclude[] |  | string | Array of ids to exclude from the search. These may be user ids or course/group ids prefixed with âcourse_â or âgroup_â respectively, e.g.exclude[]=1&exclude=2&exclude[]=course_3
type |  | string | Limit the search just to users or contexts (groups/courses).Allowed values:user,context
user_id |  | integer | Search for a specific user id. This ignores the other above parameters, and will never return more than one result.
from_conversation_id |  | integer | When searching by user_id, only users that could be normally messaged by this user will be returned. This parameter allows you to specify a conversation that will be referenced for a shared context â if both the current user and the searched user are in the conversation, the user will be returned. This is used to start new side conversations.
permissions[] |  | string | Array of permission strings to be checked for each matched context (e.g. âsend_messagesâ). This argument determines which permissions may be returned in the response; it wonât prevent contexts from being returned if they donât grant the permission(s).
