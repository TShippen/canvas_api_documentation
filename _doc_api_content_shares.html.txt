  // The id of the user who sent or received the content share.
  "user_id": 1578941,
  // The user who shared the content. This field is provided only to receivers; it
  // is not populated in the sender's list of sent content shares.
  "sender": {"id":1,"display_name":"Matilda Vargas","avatar_image_url":"http:\/\/localhost:3000\/image_url","html_url":"http:\/\/localhost:3000\/users\/1"},
  // An Array of users the content is shared with.  This field is provided only to
  // senders; an empty array will be returned for the receiving users.
  "receivers": [{"id":1,"display_name":"Jon Snow","avatar_image_url":"http:\/\/localhost:3000\/image_url2","html_url":"http:\/\/localhost:3000\/users\/2"}],
  // The course the content was originally shared from.
