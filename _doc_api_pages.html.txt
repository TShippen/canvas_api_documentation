Pages API


Pages are rich content associated with Courses and Groups in Canvas.
The Pages API allows you to create, retrieve, update, and delete pages.
Note on page identifiers
Most Pages API endpoints accept identification of the Page as either a URL
or an ID. In ambiguous cases, the URL takes precedence.
For example, if you have a page whose ID is 7 and another whose ID is 8 and whose URL is "7",
the endpoint/api/v1/courses/:course_id/pages/7will refer to the latter (ID 8).
To explicitly request by ID, you can use the form/api/v1/courses/:course_id/pages/page_id:7.


A Page object looks like:

{
  // the ID of the page
  "page_id": 1,
  // the unique locator for the page
  "url": "my-page-title",
  // the title of the page
  "title": "My Page Title",
  // the creation date for the page
  "created_at": "2012-08-06T16:46:33-06:00",
  // the date the page was last updated
  "updated_at": "2012-08-08T14:25:20-06:00",
  // (DEPRECATED) whether this page is hidden from students (note: this is always
  // reflected as the inverse of the published value)
  "hide_from_students": false,
  // roles allowed to edit the page; comma-separated list comprising a combination
  // of 'teachers', 'students', 'members', and/or 'public' if not supplied, course
  // defaults are used
  "editing_roles": "teachers,students",
  // the User who last edited the page (this may not be present if the page was
  // imported from another system)
  "last_edited_by": null,
  // the page content, in HTML (present when requesting a single page; optionally
  // included when listing pages)
  "body": "<p>Page Content</p>",
  // whether the page is published (true) or draft state (false).
  "published": true,
  // scheduled publication date for this page
  "publish_at": "2022-09-01T00:00:00",
  // whether this page is the front page for the wiki
  "front_page": false,
  // Whether or not this is locked for the user.
  "locked_for_user": false,
  // (Optional) Information for the user about the lock. Present when
  // locked_for_user is true.
  "lock_info": null,
  // (Optional) An explanation of why this is locked for the user. Present when
  // locked_for_user is true.
  "lock_explanation": "This page is locked until September 1 at 12:00am"
}


A PageRevision object looks like:

{
  // an identifier for this revision of the page
  "revision_id": 7,
  // the time when this revision was saved
  "updated_at": "2012-08-07T11:23:58-06:00",
  // whether this is the latest revision or not
  "latest": true,
  // the User who saved this revision, if applicable (this may not be present if
  // the page was imported from another system)
  "edited_by": null,
  // the following fields are not included in the index action and may be omitted
  // from the show action via summary=1 the historic url of the page
  "url": "old-page-title",
  // the historic page title
  "title": "Old Page Title",
  // the historic page contents
  "body": "<p>Old Page Content</p>"
}
