Conversations API


API for creating, accessing and updating user conversations.


A Conversation object looks like:

{
  // the unique identifier for the conversation.
  "id": 2,
  // the subject of the conversation.
  "subject": "2",
  // The current state of the conversation (read, unread or archived).
  "workflow_state": "unread",
  // A <=100 character preview from the most recent message.
  "last_message": "sure thing, here's the file",
  // the date and time at which the last message was sent.
  "start_at": "2011-09-02T12:00:00Z",
  // the number of messages in the conversation.
  "message_count": 2,
  // whether the current user is subscribed to the conversation.
  "subscribed": true,
  // whether the conversation is private.
  "private": true,
  // whether the conversation is starred.
  "starred": true,
  // Additional conversation flags (last_author, attachments, media_objects). Each
  // listed property means the flag is set to true (i.e. the current user is the
  // most recent author, there are attachments, or there are media objects)
  "properties": null,
  // Array of user ids who are involved in the conversation, ordered by
  // participation level, then alphabetical. Excludes current user, unless this is
  // a monologue.
  "audience": null,
  // Most relevant shared contexts (courses and groups) between current user and
  // other participants. If there is only one participant, it will also include
  // that user's enrollment(s)/ membership type(s) in each course/group.
  "audience_contexts": null,
  // URL to appropriate icon for this conversation (custom, individual or group
  // avatar, depending on audience).
  "avatar_url": "https://canvas.instructure.com/images/messages/avatar-group-50.png",
  // Array of users participating in the conversation. Includes current user.
  "participants": null,
  // indicates whether the conversation is visible under the current scope and
  // filter. This attribute is always true in the index API response, and is
  // primarily useful in create/update responses so that you can know if the
  // record should be displayed in the UI. The default scope is assumed, unless a
  // scope or filter is passed to the create/update API call.
  "visible": true,
  // Name of the course or group in which the conversation is occurring.
  "context_name": "Canvas 101"
}


A ConversationParticipant object looks like:

{
  // The user ID for the participant.
  "id": 2,
  // A short name the user has selected, for use in conversations or other less
  // formal places through the site.
  "name": "Shelly",
  // The full name of the user.
  "full_name": "Sheldon Cooper",
  // If requested, this field will be included and contain a url to retrieve the
  // user's avatar.
  "avatar_url": "https://canvas.instructure.com/images/messages/avatar-50.png"
}
