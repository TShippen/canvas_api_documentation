Course Quiz Extensions API


API for setting extensions on student quiz submissions at the course level


A CourseQuizExtension object looks like:

{
  // The ID of the Student that needs the quiz extension.
  "user_id": 3,
  // Number of times the student is allowed to re-take the quiz over the
  // multiple-attempt limit.
  "extra_attempts": 1,
  // Amount of extra time allowed for the quiz submission, in minutes.
  "extra_time": 60,
  // The student can take the quiz even if it's locked for everyone else
  "manually_unlocked": true,
  // The time at which the quiz submission will be overdue, and be flagged as a
  // late submission.
  "end_at": "2013-11-07T13:16:18Z"
}
