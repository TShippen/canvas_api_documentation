  "id": 101,
  // the date and time this export was requested
  "created_at": "2014-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  // the type of content migration: 'common_cartridge' or 'qti'
  "export_type": "common_cartridge",
  // attachment api object for the export package (not present before the export
  // completes or after it becomes unavailable for download.)
  "attachment": {"url":"https:\/\/example.com\/api\/v1\/attachments\/789?download_frd=1\u0026verifier=bG9sY2F0cyEh"},
  // The api endpoint for polling the current progress
  "progress_url": "https://example.com/api/v1/progress/4",
  // The ID of the user who started the export
  "user_id": 4,
  // Current state of the content migration: created exporting exported failed
