Moderated Grading API


API for viewing and adding students to the list of people in moderation
for an assignment
API for manipulating provisional grades
Provisional grades are created by using the Submissions API endpoint "Grade or comment on a submission" withprovisional=true.
They can be viewed by using "List assignment submissions", "Get a single submission", or "List gradeable students" withinclude[]=provisional_grades.
This API performs other operations on provisional grades for use with the Moderated Grading feature.


A ProvisionalGrade object looks like:

{
  // The identifier for the provisional grade
  "provisional_grade_id": 23,
  // The numeric score
  "score": 90,
  // The grade
  "grade": "A-",
  // Whether the grade was applied to the most current submission (false if the
  // student resubmitted after grading)
  "grade_matches_current_submission": true,
  // When the grade was given
  "graded_at": "2015-11-01T00:03:21-06:00",
  // Whether this is the 'final' provisional grade created by the moderator
  "final": false,
  // A link to view this provisional grade in SpeedGraderâ¢
  "speedgrader_url": "http://www.example.com/courses/123/gradebook/speed_grader?..."
