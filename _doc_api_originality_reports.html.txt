Originality Reports API


LTI API for OriginalityReports (Must useJWT access tokenswith this API).
Originality reports may be used by external tools providing plagiarism
detection services to give an originality score to an assignment
submission's file. An originality report has an associated
file ID (the file submitted by the student) and an originality score
between 0 and 100.
Note that when creating or updating an originality report atool_setting[resource_type_code]may be specified as part of the originality report.
This parameter should be used if the tool provider wishes to display
originality reports as LTI launches.
The value oftool_setting[resource_type_code]should be a
resource_handler's "resource_type" code. Canvas will lookup the resource
handler specified and do a launch to the message with the type
"basic-lti-launch-request" using its "path". If the optionaltool_setting[resource_url]parameter is provided, Canvas
will use this URL instead of the message'spathbut will
still send all the parameters specified by the message. When using thetool_setting[resource_url]thetool_setting[resource_type_code]must also be
specified.


A ToolSetting object looks like:

{
  // the resource type code of the resource handler to use to display originality
  // reports
  "resource_type_code": "originality_reports",
  // a URL that may be used to override the launch URL inferred by the specified
  // resource_type_code. If used a 'resource_type_code' must also be specified.
  "resource_url": "http://www.test.com/originality_report"
}


An OriginalityReport object looks like:

{
  // The id of the OriginalityReport
  "id": 4,
  // The id of the file receiving the originality score
  "file_id": 8,
  // A number between 0 and 100 representing the originality score
  "originality_score": 0.16,
  // The ID of the file within Canvas containing the originality report document
  // (if provided)
  "originality_report_file_id": 23,
  // A non-LTI launch URL where the originality score of the file may be found.
  "originality_report_url": "http://www.example.com/report",
  // A ToolSetting object containing optional 'resource_type_code' and
  // 'resource_url'
  "tool_setting": null,
  // A message describing the error. If set, the workflow_state will become
  // 'error.'
  "error_report": null,
  // The submitted_at date time of the submission.
  "submission_time": null,
  // The id of the root Account associated with the OriginalityReport
  "root_account_id": 1
