Learning Object Dates API


API for accessing date-related attributes on assignments, quizzes, and modules.


A LearningObjectDates object looks like:

{
  // the ID of the learning object
  "id": 4,
  // the due date for the learning object. returns null if not present or
  // applicable
  "due_at": "2012-07-01T23:59:00-06:00",
  // the lock date (learning object is locked after this date). returns null if
  // not present
  "lock_at": "2012-07-01T23:59:00-06:00",
  // the unlock date (learning object is unlocked after this date). returns null
  // if not present
  "unlock_at": "2012-07-01T23:59:00-06:00",
  // whether the learning object is only visible to overrides
  "only_visible_to_overrides": false,
  // paginated list of AssignmentOverride objects
  "overrides": null
}
