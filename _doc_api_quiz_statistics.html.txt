Quiz Statistics API


API for accessing quiz submission statistics. The statistics provided by this
interface are an aggregate of what is known as Student and Item Analysis for a
quiz.
These statistics are extracted (and composed) fromgraded(manually or, when
viable, automatically) submissions for a quiz and provide an insight into how
the participant students had responded to each question, as well as insights
into the reception of each question answer individually.
Some of these statistics are exclusive to Multiple Choice and True/False types
of questions, others to other question types. See
Quiz Statistics for a reference of these statistics.
