Webhooks Subscriptions for Plagiarism Platform API


LTI API for Webhook Subscriptions (Must useJWT access tokenswith this API).
This is intended for use with Canvas'Plagiarism Detection Platform. For
general-purpose event subscriptions seeLive Events.
The tool proxy must also have the appropriate enabled capabilities (See appendix).
Webhooks from Canvas are your way to know that a change (e.g. new or updated submission,
new or updated assignment, etc.) has taken place.
Webhooks are available via HTTPS to an endpoint you own and specify, or via
an AWS SQS queue that you provision, own, and specify. We recommend SQS for
the most robust integration, but do support HTTPS for lower volume applications.
We do not deduplicate or batch messages before transmission. Avoid
creating multiple identical subscriptions. Webhooks always identify the ID
of the subscription that caused them to be sent, allowing you to identify
problematic or high volume subscriptions.
We cannot guarantee the transmission order of webhooks. If order is important
to your application, you must check the "event_time" attribute in the
"metadata" hash to determine sequence.
