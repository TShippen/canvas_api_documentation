Retrieve assignments enabled for grade export to SISSisApiController#sis_assignments



GET /api/sis/accounts/:account_id/assignments



GET /api/sis/courses/:course_id/assignments

Retrieve a list of published assignments flagged as âpost_to_sisâ. See the Assignments API for more details on assignments. Assignment group and section information are included for convenience.
Each section includes course information for the origin course and the cross-listed course, if applicable. The âorigin_course` is the course to which the section belongs or the course from which the section was cross-listed. Generally, the `origin_course` should be preferred when performing integration work. The `xlist_course` is provided for consistency and is only present when the section has been cross-listed. See Sections API and Courses Api for me details.
The âoverride` is only provided if the Differentiated Assignments course feature is turned on and the assignment has an override for that section. When there is an override for the assignment the override objectâs keys/values can be merged with the top level assignment object to create a view of the assignment object specific to that section. See Assignments api for more information on assignment overrides.
