Users API


API for accessing information on the current and other users.
Throughout this API, the:user_idparameter can be replaced withselfas
a shortcut for the id of the user accessing the API. For instance,users/:user_id/page_viewscan be accessed asusers/self/page_viewsto
access the current user's page views.
API for manipulating course nicknames
Course nicknames are alternate names for courses that are unique to each user.
They are useful when the course's name is too long or less meaningful.
If a user defines a nickname for a course, that name will be returned by the
API in place of the course's actual name.

POST /api/v1/accounts/:account_id/users

Create and return a new user and pseudonym for an account.
If you donât have the âModify
login details for usersâ permission, but self-registration is enabled on the account, you can still use this endpoint to register new users. Certain fields will be required, and others will be ignored (see below).
Parameter |  | Type | Description
user[name] |  | string | The full name of the user. This name will be used by teacher for grading. Required if this is a self-registration.
user[short_name] |  | string | Userâs name as it will be displayed in discussions, messages, and comments.
user[sortable_name] |  | string | Userâs name as used to sort alphabetically in lists.
user[time_zone] |  | string | The time zone for the user. Allowed time zones areIANA time zonesor friendlierRuby on Rails time zones.
user[locale] |  | string | The userâs preferred language, from the list of languages Canvas supports. This is in RFC-5646 format.
user[terms_of_use] |  | boolean | Whether the user accepts the terms of use. Required if this is a self-registration and this canvas instance requires users to accept the terms (on by default).If this is true, it will mark the user as having accepted the terms of use.
user[skip_registration] |  | boolean | Automatically mark the user as registered.If this is true, it is recommended to set"pseudonym[send_confirmation]"to true as well. Otherwise, the user will not receive any messages about their account creation.The users communication channel confirmation can be skipped by setting"communication_channel[skip_confirmation]"to true as well.
pseudonym[unique_id] | Required | string | Userâs login ID. If this is a self-registration, it must be a valid email address.
pseudonym[password] |  | string | Userâs password. Cannot be set during self-registration.
pseudonym[sis_user_id] |  | string | SIS ID for the userâs account. To set this parameter, the caller must be able to manage SIS permissions.
pseudonym[integration_id] |  | string | Integration ID for the login. To set this parameter, the caller must be able to manage SIS permissions. The Integration ID is a secondary identifier useful for more complex SIS integrations.
pseudonym[send_confirmation] |  | boolean | Send user notification of account creation if true. Automatically set to true during self-registration.
pseudonym[force_self_registration] |  | boolean | Send user a self-registration style email if true. Setting it means the users will get a notification asking them to âcomplete the registration processâ by clicking it, setting a password, and letting them in.  Will only be executed on if the user does not need admin approval. Defaults to false unless explicitly provided.
pseudonym[authentication_provider_id] |  | string | The authentication provider this login is associated with. Logins associated with a specific provider can only be used with that provider. Legacy providers (LDAP, CAS, SAML) will search for logins associated with them, or unassociated logins. New providers will only search for logins explicitly associated with them. This can be the integer ID of the provider, or the type of the provider (in which case, it will find the first matching provider).
communication_channel[type] |  | string | The communication channel type, e.g. âemailâ or âsmsâ.
communication_channel[address] |  | string | The communication channel address, e.g. the userâs email address.
communication_channel[confirmation_url] |  | boolean | Only valid for account admins. If true, returns the new user account confirmation URL in the response.
communication_channel[skip_confirmation] |  | boolean | Only valid for site admins and account admins making requests; If true, the channel is automatically validated and no confirmation email or SMS is sent. Otherwise, the user must respond to a confirmation message to confirm the channel.If this is true, it is recommended to set"pseudonym[send_confirmation]"to true as well. Otherwise, the user will not receive any messages about their account creation.
force_validations |  | boolean | If true, validations are performed on the newly created user (and their associated pseudonym) even if the request is made by a privileged user like an admin. When set to false, or not included in the request parameters, any newly created users are subject to validations unless the request is made by a user with a âmanage_user_loginsâ right. In which case, certain validations such as ârequire_acceptance_of_termsâ and ârequire_presence_of_nameâ are not enforced. Use this parameter to return helpful json errors while building users with an admin request.
enable_sis_reactivation |  | boolean | When true, will first try to re-activate a deleted user with matching sis_user_id if possible. This is commonly done withuserandcommunication_channelso that the default communication_channel is also restored.
destination |  | URL | If youâre setting the password for the newly created user, you can provide this param with a valid URL pointing into this Canvas installation, and the response will include a destination field thatâs a URL that you can redirect a browser to and have the newly created user automatically logged in. The URL is only valid for a short time, and must match the domain this request is directed to, and be for a well-formed path that Canvas can recognize.
initial_enrollment_type |  | string | âobserver` if doing a self-registration with a pairing code. This allows setting the password during user creation.

Terminate all user sessionsUsersController#terminate_sessions



DELETE /api/v1/users/:id/sessions

Terminates all sessions for a user. This includes all browser-based sessions and all access tokens, including manually generated ones. The user can immediately re-authenticate to access Canvas again if they have the current credentials. All integrations will need to be re-authorized.


Merge user into another userUsersController#merge_into



PUT /api/v1/users/:id/merge_into/:destination_user_id



PUT /api/v1/users/:id/merge_into/accounts/:destination_account_id/users/:destination_user_id

Merge a user into another user. To merge users, the caller must have permissions to manage both users. This should be considered irreversible. This will delete the user and move all the data into the destination user.
User merge details and caveats: The from_user is the user that was deleted in the user_merge process. The destination_user is the user that remains, that is being split.
Avatars: When both users have avatars, only the destination_users avatar will remain. When one user has an avatar, will it will end up on the destination_user.
Terms of Use: If either user has accepted terms of use, it will be be left as accepted.
Communication Channels: All unique communication channels moved to the destination_user. All notification preferences are moved to the destination_user.
Enrollments: All unique enrollments are moved to the destination_user. When there is an enrollment that would end up making it so that a user would be observing themselves, the enrollment is not moved over. Everything that is tied to the from_user at the course level relating to the enrollment is also moved to the destination_user.
Submissions: All submissions are moved to the destination_user. If there are enrollments for both users in the same course, we prefer submissions that have grades then submissions that have work in them, and if there are no grades or no work, they are not moved.
Other notes: Access Tokens are moved on merge. Conversations are moved on merge. Favorites are moved on merge. Courses will commonly use LTI tools. LTI tools reference the user with IDs that are stored on a user object. Merging users deletes one user and moves all records from the deleted user to the destination_user. These IDs are kept for all enrollments, group_membership, and account_users for the from_user at the time of the merge. When the destination_user launches an LTI tool from a course that used to be the from_userâs, it doesnât appear as a new user to the tool provider. Instead it will send the stored ids. The destination_userâs LTI IDs remain as they were for the courses that they originally had. Future enrollments for the destination_user will use the IDs that are on the destination_user object. LTI IDs that are kept and tracked per context include lti_context_id, lti_id and uuid. APIs that return the LTI ids will return the one for the context that it is called for, except for the user uuid. The user UUID will display the destination_users uuid, and when getting the uuid from an api that is in a context that was recorded from a merge event, an additional attribute is added as past_uuid.
When finding users by SIS ids in different accounts the destination_account_id is required.
The account can also be identified by passing the domain in destination_account_id.

Split merged users into separate usersUsersController#split



POST /api/v1/users/:id/split

Merged users cannot be fully restored to their previous state, but this will attempt to split as much as possible to the previous state. To split a merged user, the caller must have permissions to manage all of the users logins. If there are multiple users that have been merged into one user it will split each merge into a separate user. A split can only happen within 180 days of a user merge. A user merge deletes the previous user and may be permanently deleted. In this scenario we create a new user object and proceed to move as much as possible to the new user. The user object will not have preserved the name or settings from the previous user. Some items may have been deleted during a user_merge that cannot be restored, and/or the data has become stale because of other changes to the objects since the time of the user_merge.
Split users details and caveats:
The from_user is the user that was deleted in the user_merge process. The destination_user is the user that remains, that is being split.
Avatars: When both users had avatars, both will be remain. When from_user had an avatar and destination_user did not have an avatar, the destination_userâs avatar will be deleted if it still matches what was there are the time of the merge. If the destination_userâs avatar was changed at anytime after the merge, it will remain on the destination user. If the from_user had an avatar it will be there after split.
Terms of Use: If from_user had not accepted terms of use, they will be prompted again to accept terms of use after the split. If the destination_user had not accepted terms of use, hey will be prompted again to accept terms of use after the split. If neither user had accepted the terms of use, but since the time of the merge had accepted, both will be prompted to accept terms of use. If both had accepted terms of use, this will remain.
Communication Channels: All communication channels are restored to what they were prior to the merge. If a communication channel was added after the merge, it will remain on the destination_user. Notification preferences remain with the communication channels.
Enrollments: All enrollments from the time of the merge will be moved back to where they were. Enrollments created since the time of the merge that were created by sis_import will go to the user that owns that sis_id used for the import. Other new enrollments will remain on the destination_user. Everything that is tied to the destination_user at the course level relating to an enrollment is moved to the from_user. When both users are in the same course prior to merge this can cause some unexpected items to move.
Submissions: Unlike other items tied to a course, submissions are explicitly recorded to avoid problems with grades. All submissions were moved are restored to the spot prior to merge. All submission that were created in a course that was moved in enrollments are moved over to the from_user.
Other notes: Access Tokens are moved back on split. Conversations are moved back on split. Favorites that existing at the time of merge are moved back on split. LTI ids are restored to how they were prior to merge.

Additionally, all records will include a âtypeâ field and a âtokenâ field. The following explains each field in more detail
The type of avatar record, for categorization purposes.
The url of the avatar
A unique representation of the avatar record which can be used to set the avatar with the user update endpoint. Note: this is an internal representation and is subject to change without notice. It should be consumed with this api endpoint and used in the user update endpoint, and should not be constructed by the client.
A textual description of the avatar record
the internal id of the attachment
the content-type of the attachment
the filename of the attachment
the size of the attachment

Store custom dataCustomDataController#set_data



PUT /api/v1/users/:user_id/custom_data(/*scope)

Store arbitrary user data as JSON.
Arbitrary JSON data can be stored for a User. A typical scenario would be an external site/service that registers users in Canvas and wants to capture additional info about them.  The part of the URL that follows/custom_data/defines the scope of the request, and it reflects the structure of the JSON data to be stored or retrieved.
The valueselfmay be used foruser_idto store data associated with the calling user. In order to access another userâs custom data, you must be an account administrator with permission to manage users.
A namespace parameter,ns, is used to prevent custom_data collisions between different apps.  This parameter is required for all custom_data requests.
A request with Content-Type multipart/form-data or Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded can only be used to store strings.
Example PUT with multipart/form-data data:
curl 'https://<canvas>/api/v1/users/<user_id>/custom_data/telephone' \
  -X PUT \
  -F 'ns=com.my-organization.canvas-app' \
  -F 'data=555-1234' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
Response:
{
  "data": "555-1234"
}
Subscopes (or, generated scopes) can also be specified by passing values todata[subscope].
Example PUT specifying subscopes:
curl 'https://<canvas>/api/v1/users/<user_id>/custom_data/body/measurements' \
  -X PUT \
  -F 'ns=com.my-organization.canvas-app' \
  -F 'data[waist]=32in' \
  -F 'data[inseam]=34in' \
  -F 'data[chest]=40in' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
Response:
{
  "data": {
    "chest": "40in",
    "waist": "32in",
    "inseam": "34in"
  }
}
Following such a request, subsets of the stored data to be retrieved directly from a subscope.
ExampleGETfrom a generated scope
curl 'https://<canvas>/api/v1/users/<user_id>/custom_data/body/measurements/chest' \
  -X GET \
  -F 'ns=com.my-organization.canvas-app' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
Response:
{
  "data": "40in"
}
If you want to store more than just strings (i.e. numbers, arrays, hashes, true, false, and/or null), you must make a request with Content-Type application/json as in the following example.
Example PUT with JSON data:
curl 'https://<canvas>/api/v1/users/<user_id>/custom_data' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -X PUT \
  -d '{
        "ns": "com.my-organization.canvas-app",
        "data": {
          "a-number": 6.02e23,
          "a-bool": true,
          "a-string": "true",
          "a-hash": {"a": {"b": "ohai"}},
          "an-array": [1, "two", null, false]
        }
      }' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
Response:
{
  "data": {
    "a-number": 6.02e+23,
    "a-bool": true,
    "a-string": "true",
    "a-hash": {
      "a": {
        "b": "ohai"
      }
    },
    "an-array": [1, "two", null, false]
  }
}
If the data is an Object (as it is in the above example), then subsets of the data can be accessed by including the objectâs (possibly nested) keys in the scope of a GET request.
ExampleGETwith a generated scope:
curl 'https://<canvas>/api/v1/users/<user_id>/custom_data/a-hash/a/b' \
  -X GET \
  -F 'ns=com.my-organization.canvas-app' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
Response:
{
  "data": "ohai"
}
On success, this endpoint returns an object containing the data that was stored.
Responds with status code 200 if the scope already contained data, and it was overwritten by the data specified in the request.
Responds with status code 201 if the scope was previously empty, and the data specified in the request was successfully stored there.
Responds with status code 400 if the namespace parameter,ns, is missing or invalid, or if thedataparameter is missing.
Responds with status code 409 if the requested scope caused a conflict and data was not stored. This happens when storing data at the requested scope would cause data at an outer scope to be lost.  e.g., if/custom_datawas{âfashion_appâ: {âhairâ: âblondeâ}}, but you tried toâPUT /custom_data/fashion_app/hair/style -F data=buzz`, then for the request to succeed,the value of/custom_data/fashion_app/hairwould have to become a hash, and its old string value would be lost.  In this situation, an error object is returned with the following format:
{
  "message": "write conflict for custom_data hash",
  "conflict_scope": "fashion_app/hair",
  "type_at_conflict": "String",
  "value_at_conflict": "blonde"
}
Parameter |  | Type | Description
ns | Required | string | The namespace under which to store the data.  This should be something other Canvas API apps arenât likely to use, such as a reverse DNS for your organization.
data | Required | JSON | The data you want to store for the user, at the specified scope.  If the data is composed of (possibly nested) JSON objects, scopes will be generated for the (nested) keys (see examples).
