  // The current published state of the item, synced with the associated object
  "workflow_state": "published",
  // Controls whether or not the associated plannable item is marked complete on
  // the planner
  "marked_complete": false,
  // Controls whether or not the associated plannable item shows up in the
  // opportunities list
  "dismissed": false,
  // The datetime of when the planner override was created
  "created_at": "2017-05-09T10:12:00Z",
