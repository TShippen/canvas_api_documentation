  "has_public_results": true,
  // The time at which the poll session was created.
  "created_at": "2014-01-07T15:16:18Z",
  // The results of the submissions of the poll. Each key is the poll choice id,
  // and the value is the count of submissions.
  "results": {"144":10,"145":3,"146":27,"147":8},
  // If the poll session has public results, this will return an array of all
  // submissions, viewable by both students and teachers. If the results are not
  // public, for students it will return their submission only.
