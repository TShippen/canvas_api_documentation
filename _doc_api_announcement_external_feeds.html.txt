Announcement External Feeds API


External feeds represent RSS feeds that can be attached to a Course or Group,
in order to automatically create announcements for each new item in
the feed.


An ExternalFeed object looks like:

{
  // The ID of the feed
  "id": 5,
  // The title of the feed, pulled from the feed itself. If the feed hasn't yet
  // been pulled, a temporary name will be synthesized based on the URL
  "display_name": "My Blog",
  // The HTTP/HTTPS URL to the feed
  "url": "http://example.com/myblog.rss",
  // If not null, only feed entries whose title contains this string will trigger
  // new posts in Canvas
  "header_match": "pattern",
  // When this external feed was added to Canvas
  "created_at": "2012-06-01T00:00:00-06:00",
  // The verbosity setting determines how much of the feed's content is imported
  // into Canvas as part of the posting. 'link_only' means that only the title and
  // a link to the item. 'truncate' means that a summary of the first portion of
  // the item body will be used. 'full' means that the full item body will be
  // used.
  "verbosity": "truncate"
}
