JWTs API


Short term tokens useful for talking to other services in the Canvas Ecosystem.
Note: JWTs have no value or use directly against the Canvas API, and expire
after one hour


A JWT object looks like:

{
  // The signed, encrypted, base64 encoded JWT
  "token": "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"
