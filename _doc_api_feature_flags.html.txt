Feature Flags API


Manage optional features in Canvas.
Deprecated[2016-01-15] FeatureFlags previously had a locking_account_id field;
 it was never used, and has been removed. It is still included in API responses
 for backwards compatibility reasons. Its value is always null.


A Feature object looks like:

{
  // The symbolic name of the feature, used in FeatureFlags
  "feature": "fancy_wickets",
  // The user-visible name of the feature
  "display_name": "Fancy Wickets",
  // The type of object the feature applies to (RootAccount, Account, Course, or
  // User):
  // * RootAccount features may only be controlled by flags on root accounts.
  // * Account features may be controlled by flags on accounts and their parent
  // accounts.
  // * Course features may be controlled by flags on courses and their parent
  // accounts.
  // * User features may be controlled by flags on users and site admin only.
  "applies_to": "Course",
  // The FeatureFlag that applies to the caller
  "feature_flag": {"feature":"fancy_wickets","state":"allowed"},
  // If true, a feature that is 'allowed' globally will be 'off' by default in
  // root accounts. Otherwise, root accounts inherit the global 'allowed' setting,
  // which allows sub-accounts and courses to turn features on with no root
  // account action.
  "root_opt_in": true,
  // Whether the feature is a feature preview. If true, opting in includes ongoing
  // updates outside the regular release schedule.
  "beta": true,
  // Whether the details of the feature are autoexpanded on page load vs. the user
  // clicking to expand.
  "autoexpand": true,
  // A URL to the release notes describing the feature
  "release_notes_url": "http://canvas.example.com/release_notes#fancy_wickets"
}


A FeatureFlag object looks like:

{
  // The type of object to which this flag applies (Account, Course, or User).
  // (This field is not present if this FeatureFlag represents the global Canvas
  // default)
  "context_type": "Account",
  // The id of the object to which this flag applies (This field is not present if
  // this FeatureFlag represents the global Canvas default)
  "context_id": 1038,
  // The feature this flag controls
  "feature": "fancy_wickets",
  // The policy for the feature at this context.  can be 'off', 'allowed',
  // 'allowed_on', or 'on'.
  "state": "allowed",
  // If set, this feature flag cannot be changed in the caller's context because
  // the flag is set 'off' or 'on' in a higher context
  "locked": false
}

GET /api/v1/users/:user_id/features/flags/:feature

Get the feature flag that applies to a given Account, Course, or User. The flag may be defined on the object, or it may be inherited from a parent account. You can look at the context_id and context_type of the returned object to determine which is the case. If these fields are missing, then the object is the global Canvas default.

DELETE /api/v1/users/:user_id/features/flags/:feature

Remove feature flag for a given Account, Course, or User.  (Note that the flag must be defined on the Account, Course, or User directly.)  The object will then inherit the feature flags from a higher account, if any exist.  If this flag was âonâ or âoffâ, then lower-level account flags that were masked by this one will apply again.
