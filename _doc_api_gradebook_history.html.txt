Gradebook History API


API for accessing the versioned history of student submissions along with their
grade changes, organized by the date of the submission.


A Grader object looks like:

{
  // the user_id of the user who graded the contained submissions
  "id": 27,
  // the name of the user who graded the contained submissions
  "name": "Some User",
  // the assignment groups for all submissions in this response that were graded
  // by this user.  The details are not nested inside here, but the fact that an
  // assignment is present here means that the grader did grade submissions for
  // this assignment on the contextual date. You can use the id of a grader and of
  // an assignment to make another API call to find all submissions for a
  // grader/assignment combination on a given date.
  "assignments": [1, 2, 3]
}


A Day object looks like:

{
  // the date represented by this entry
  "date": "1986-08-09",

  // response. the submissions are grouped according to the person who graded them
  // and the assignment they were submitted for.
  "graders": []
}
