New Quiz Items API


API for accessing and building items inside a New Quiz. To interact with the quiz itself,
see theNew Quizzes API.
Glossary:
Quiz Itemscan be among several types as described here.  For now, all types can be retrieved (GET), but some types are
restricted to only that functionality.
QuestionItem: question items are the various question types allowed for Quizzes.  These question types can be
created, updated, retrieved, and deleted with the API.  See the Appendix for more details.
StimulusItem: stimulus items are quiz items that define a stimulus that can have associated questions attached to
it.  For now, stimulus items can only be retrieved with the API.  They must be created and updated via the UI.
BankItem: bank items are quiz questions or other items that are part of an item bank.  For now, bank items can only
be retrieved with the API.  They must be created and updated via the UI.
BankEntry: bank entry items allow for a random selection of items from an associated bank to be included in the
quiz.  For now, bank items can only be retrieved with the API.  They must be created and updated via the UI.
